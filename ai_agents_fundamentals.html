      <h2>What Are AI Agents?</h2>
      <p>AI agents are programs that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals autonomously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Types of AI Agents</h2>
      <p>Reactive agents respond to current situations; model-based agents plan using internal knowledge; goal-based and learning agents adapt through feedback and experience.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>How Agents Work</h2>
      <p>Agents use sensors to gather information, apply logic or learned patterns, and use actuators to interact with their surroundings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>AI agents are behind chatbots, recommendation systems, robotics, and automated decision-making tools used in everyday life.</p>
